iSSB-Windows
============

iSSB is a mobile version of the popular game "Super Smash Bros. Brawl". iSSB-Windows is a version of iSSB that runs on top of SFML instead of SDL, allowing it to run on Windows with very minor changes to the codebase.

This project is made for Visual C++ Express 2013.

IMPORTANT: In order for it to compile "static" correctly, you must put the files from the folder "SFML/bin" into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin". The path may be slightly different, depending on where you installed Visual Studio.
